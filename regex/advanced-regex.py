## QUESTION Add to the regular expression used in the extract_pid function, to return the uppercase message in parenthesis, after the process id.

def extract_pid(log_line):
    regex = r"\[(\d+)\]: (\w+)"
    result = re.search(regex, log_line)
    if result is None:
        return None
    return "{} ({})".format(result[1], result[2])


# 12345 (ERROR)
print(extract_pid(
    "July 31 07:51:48 mycomputer bad_process[12345]: ERROR Performing package upgrade"))
print(extract_pid("99 elephants in a [cage]"))  # None
print(extract_pid(
    "A string that also has numbers [34567] but no uppercase message"))  # None
# 67890 (RUNNING)
print(extract_pid(
    "July 31 08:08:08 mycomputer new_process[67890]: RUNNING Performing backup"))

## We want to split a piece of text by either the word "a" or "the", as implemented in the following code. What is the resulting split list?

re.split(r"the|a", "One sentence. Another one? And the last one!")


## We're working with a CSV file, which contains employee information. Each record has a name field, followed by a phone number field, and a role field. The phone number field contains U.S. phone numbers, and needs to be modified to the international format, with "+1-" in front of the phone number. Fill in the regular expression, using groups, to use the transform_record function to do that.


def transform_record(record):
  new_record = re.sub(r"([\w ]*),([\d-]*),(\w*)", r"\1,+1-\2,\3", record)
  return new_record


print(transform_record("Sabrina Green,802-867-5309,System Administrator"))
# Sabrina Green,+1-802-867-5309,System Administrator

print(transform_record("Eli Jones,684-3481127,IT specialist"))
# Eli Jones,+1-684-3481127,IT specialist

print(transform_record("Melody Daniels,846-687-7436,Programmer"))
# Melody Daniels,+1-846-687-7436,Programmer

print(transform_record("Charlie Rivera,698-746-3357,Web Developer"))
# Charlie Rivera,+1-698-746-3357,Web Developer


## The multi_vowel_words function returns all words with 3 or more consecutive vowels (a, e, i, o, u). Fill in the regular expression to do that.

def multi_vowel_words(text):
  pattern = r"(\w*[aeiou]{3,}\w*)"
  result = re.findall(pattern, text)
  return result


print(multi_vowel_words("Life is beautiful"))
# ['beautiful']

print(multi_vowel_words("Obviously, the queen is courageous and gracious."))
# ['Obviously', 'queen', 'courageous', 'gracious']

print(multi_vowel_words(
    "The rambunctious children had to sit quietly and await their delicious dinner."))
# ['rambunctious', 'quietly', 'delicious']

print(multi_vowel_words("The order of a data queue is First In First Out (FIFO)"))
# ['queue']

print(multi_vowel_words("Hello world!"))
# []
re.group return list or tuple


## Q The transform_comments function converts comments in a Python script into those usable by a C compiler. This means looking for text that begins with a hash mark(  # ) and replacing it with double slashes (//), which is the C single-line comment indicator. For the purpose of this exercise, we'll ignore the possibility of a hash mark embedded inside of a Python command, and assume that it's only used to indicate a comment. We also want to treat repetitive hash marks (##), (###), etc., as a single comment indicator, to be replaced with just (//) and not (#//) or (//#). Fill in the parameters of the substitution method to complete this function:


def transform_comments(line_of_code):
  result = re.sub(r"^(#+) ([\w ]*)", r"\\\\ \2", line_of_code)
  return result


print(transform_comments("### Start of program"))
# Should be "// Start of program"
print(transform_comments("  number = 0   ## Initialize the variable"))
# Should be "  number = 0   // Initialize the variable"
print(transform_comments("  number += 1   # Increment the variable"))
# Should be "  number += 1   // Increment the variable"
print(transform_comments("  return(number)"))
# Should be "  return(number)"


## Q The convert_phone_number function checks for a U.S. phone number format: XXX-XXX-XXXX(3 digits followed by a dash, 3 more digits followed by a dash, and 4 digits), and converts it to a more formal format that looks like this: (XXX) XXX-XXXX. Fill in the regular expression to complete this function.

def convert_phone_number(phone):
  result = re.sub(r"\b(\d{3})\b-\b(\d{3})\b-\b(\d{4})\b", r"(\1) \2-\3", phone)
  return result


# My number is (212) 345-9999.
print(convert_phone_number("My number is 212-345-9999."))
# Please call (888) 555-1234
print(convert_phone_number("Please call 888-555-1234"))
print(convert_phone_number("123-123-12345"))  # 123-123-12345
# Phone number of Buckingham Palace is +44 303 123 7300
print(convert_phone_number("Phone number of Buckingham Palace is +44 303 123 7300"))

#watch out boundaries \b element to limitate to exactly number of digits
